A simple Node.js todo application

### start mongodb

Run `mongod --dbpath data` from the root directory after ensuring that there is a data/ folder in the root of the project.

### start node server

Run `node index.js` from the root directory.

Alternatively, you can run `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed (which automatically restarts the server, yay).
